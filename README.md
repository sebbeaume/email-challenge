# It's Mailtime!

## Background (Basic)

To ensure workers are making the most of their time, HQ has decided to track the time it takes for employees to reply on
emails.

You will be presented an extract of the emails sent in the company, between workers at different locations around the
world.
Your goal is to find the average response time in seconds, rounded off, of each of these workers.

### Example:

- Alice sent an email the Bob on the **Friday 12 April at 15:00 Paris time**, which corresponds to **21:00 in
  Singapore Time**
- Bob responded to this email on the **Monday 15 April at 9:00 Singapore time**, which corresponds to **03:00 in Paris
  time**
- Alice responded to this email on the *Tuesday 16 April at 09:05 Paris time**
- The time elapsed between the moment Bob received the email and the time he answered is **60 hours**, or **216 000
  seconds**
- The time elapsed between the moment Alice received Bob's response and the time she answered is **30 hours and 5
  minutes**, or **108 300 seconds**

The company is however aware that simply checking the average response time is not a significant KPI, and could lead to
misinterpretation of the employees performance, as they are based in different timezones. Thus, you will be rewarded
only a **quarter of the maximum possible points per user** for finding these statistic correctly.

## Working Hours! (Advanced)

For the full score, the company wants you to take into account the working hours of each of the employees when
calculating their average response time.

### Example:

- Alice sent an email the Bob on the **Friday 12 April at 15:00 Paris time**, which corresponds to **21:00 in
  Singapore Time**
- Bob responded to this email on the **Monday 15 April at 9:00 Singapore time**, which corresponds to **03:00 in Paris
  time**
- Alice responded to this email on the *Tuesday 16 April at 09:05 Paris time**
- Bob, like every employee of the company, **doesn't work on the weekends**
- Bob answered **1 hour after the start of his next working day** : he thus took **3600 seconds** to answer the email
- Alice received the response on the Monday morning at 3Am **before her working hours**
- Alice failed to respond during her working hours of **9 AM to 6 PM**
- Alice responded on the next day, **5 minutes after the start of her working day**
- Thus, she took **one full working day + 5 minutes** to answer, or (18-9) hours + 5 minutes = **32 700 seconds**

## Input

We will `POST` the following JSON to an endpoint `/mailtime`:

```json
{
  "emails": [
    {
      "subject": "subject",
      "sender": "Alice",
      "receiver": "Bob",
      "timeSent": "2024-04-12T15:00:00+02:00"
    },
    {
      "subject": "RE: subject",
      "sender": "Bob",
      "receiver": "Alice",
      "timeSent": "2024-04-15T09:00:00+08:00"
    },
    {
      "subject": "RE: RE: subject",
      "sender": "Alice",
      "receiver": "Bob",
      "timeSent": "2024-04-16T09:05:00+02:00"
    }
  ],
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "officeHours": {
        "timeZone": "Europe/Paris",
        "start": 9,
        "end": 18
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob",
      "officeHours": {
        "timeZone": "Asia/Singapore",
        "start": 8,
        "end": 17
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output

Your expected output. You will either be answering for the Basic part, or Advanced part (factoring in working hours).

We suggest solving for the Basic answers first, before attempting to factor in working hours.

```json
{ "response": 
    {
        "Alice": 32700,
        "Bob": 3600
    }
}
```

## Assumptions

* `emails` input are not in order.
* There are no branches within an email thread.
* The first email subject in a thread will not start with `RE: `; each reply on the email chain will consistently
  prefix `RE: ` to the subject.
* Sender can only send emails during their office hours.
* Senders will not reply to their own emails.
* The timestamps are generated from `2024-05-01` (epoch), so there should not be a need to factor in daylight savings.

## Scoring

For each user:

* If your output matches the expected answer for the Advanced part, you get 4 points.
* If your output matches the expected answer for the Basic part, you get 1 point (hence a quarter).
* Otherwise, you get 0 points.

The average across your users is calculated and rounded off to the nearest integer, and then multiplied by 5 for a
maximum of 20 points per evaluation.

There will be 5 runs for a total of 100 points, before applying the challenge weightage.
